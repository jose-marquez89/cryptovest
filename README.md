# cryptovest
A crypto investment tracker with *very* basic authentication. Built with the plotly dash framework.

## Project State
I decided to park/archive this project in favor of using a different framework than  plotly dash. Unfortunately, I wasn't going to be able to get the kind of security that I needed to handle respectable user authentication and possible interaction with the coinbase API.
